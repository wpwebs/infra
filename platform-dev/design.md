## Strategy for Kubernetes-Based WordPress Hosting Service

### Service Provision Strategy:
- **Automated Deployment:** Utilize scripts to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **Open Source Solutions:** Leverage open-source tools and platforms to reduce costs and increase flexibility.
- **Customer Isolation:** Deploy a separate WordPress instance, including its database, for each customer to ensure isolation and security.
### Starting Phase:
- **Cloud VM Rentals:** Begin by renting virtual machines (VMs) from cloud vendors such as Linode, AWS, and Bluehost.
- **OS and Kubernetes Installation:** Install Flatcar OS on the VMs and then deploy Kubernetes to establish the infrastructure.
### Second Phase:
- **Bare Metal Servers:** Transition to renting bare metal servers from data centers to enhance performance and control.
- **Proxmox and Flatcar Deployment:** Install Proxmox on the bare metal servers and deploy Flatcar OS on VMs within Proxmox for improved resource management and scalability.
### Long-Term Phase:
- **Hardware Purchase and Colocation:** As demand increases, purchase hardware and rent colocation spaces in high-demand regions to reduce long-term costs and improve performance.
- **Proxmox and Flatcar Deployment:** Continue using Proxmox on bare metal servers and deploying Flatcar OS on VMs to maintain a consistent and scalable infrastructure.
